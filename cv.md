Here is a solution to a problem from Codewars:

'You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.'

```javascript
function getMiddle(s)
{
  if (s.length % 2 === 0) {
    const middlePoint = s.length / 2 - 1;
    return s.charAt(middlePoint) + s.charAt(middlePoint + 1)
